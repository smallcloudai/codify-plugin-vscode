*Refact for VS Code is a free, open-source AI code assistant*

- **AI Toolbox:** Apply functions for bug detection and fixing, code refactoring, documentation assistance, code review, and more. 
- **Integrated AI Chat:** Use natural language to ask code questions and get answers seamlessly.

## Getting Started
Once [installed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smallcloud.codify), look for the Refact.ai logo in the status bar or the sidebar, click 'login', and agree to T&C. Start typing some code, and autocomplete will make suggestions automatically! Press F1 to access the AI toolbox functions. Refact has a simple, user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use, even for those new to AI tools.
If you have your own NVIDIA GPU, you can try the [self-hosted version](https://github.com/smallcloudai/refact).
